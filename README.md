# The Vickaryous & Hall Human Cell Type Catalog

## Overview

In 2006, Vickaryous and Hall published a comprehensive list of over 400 human cell types. By 2024, this is still the most up-to-date explicit catalog of cell types. This website is a semantic-web version of the catalog, leveraging the infrastructure of Wikidata to enable navigation on the catalog, complemented with encyclopedic texts from Wikipedia.

The cell types collected by Vickaryous and Hall were divided into categories named assemblages, shown below.

Have fun! Here are some example cell types:

 * [Hepatocyte](https://cellcatalog.toolforge.org/cell/Q827450)
 * [Spermatozoon](https://cellcatalog.toolforge.org/cell/Q74560)
 * [Schwann Cell](https://cellcatalog.toolforge.org/cell/Q465621)
